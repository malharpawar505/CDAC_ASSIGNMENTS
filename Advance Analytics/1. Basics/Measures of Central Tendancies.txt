11. You work for a company that manufactures light bulbs. The quality control department is concerned about the lifespan of their bulbs. They randomly sample 100 bulbs from a production run and measure their lifespans. The mean lifespan is 1500 hours, and the standard deviation is 100 hours. Calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) and interpret what it tells you about the variability of bulb lifespans.
